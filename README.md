# Tip-and-Score Game
This is a game created by myself. There will be a bar on top and a paddle on bottom. The ball which will be placed on the centre will move down. if the ball hits the paddle it reflects and moves up. If the ball hits the top bar the player will get 500 points. The speed of the ball movement also increases after 4500 points. 
This game is very relaxing and stressfree
